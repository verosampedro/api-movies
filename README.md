# Api-movies exercise

## What did the exercise consist of?

The exercise consisted of creating our own API. Through the filmaffinity.com page we had to create 5 endpoints:

1. Get all the movies (to our liking).
2. Get a movie through its ID. 
3. Add a movie.
4. Update the data of a movie. 
5. Delete a movie.

In this case I have chosen these 5 movies: 'Barbie', 'Forrest Gump', 'Kick Ass', 'Hauru no Ugoku Shiro' and 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. Being able to make all the necessary checks through the Postman application. 

In Postman we will be able to visualize the title of each movie, its ID, year of release, genre (main genre, as they can have many subgenres), duration in minutes and a short synopsis of each one.
